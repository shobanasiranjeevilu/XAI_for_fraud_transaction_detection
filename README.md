## XAI_for_fraud_transaction_detection

Implementing an Explainable AI (XAI) system provides a transparent and interpretable fraud detection models.​ XAI would allow the company to understand the factors and patterns the model considers when flagging claims as fraudulent or legitimate.​ This enhanced understanding would enable the company to fine-tune the model to reduce false positives (legitimate claims flagged as fraudulent) and false negatives, thus lowering operational costs and improving customer satisfaction.​
